Example file:

```yaml
#Example playbook
- 
    hosts: db1 # as in the inventory
    name: play1
    tasks:
        - name: Execute a command
          command: date
          
        - name: Execute the scrit
          script: test_script.sh
          
-
    hosts: db2 # as in the inventory
    name: play2
    tasks:
        - name: Execute a command
          command: date
          
        - name: install web services
          yum:
          	name: httpd
                state: present

## Check modules:

```Linux
ansible-doc -l
```

To run a playbook

```Linux
ansible-playbook <playboo-name>
```
			OR
			
			
Without Playbooks:
```linux
ansible <host> -a <command>
ansible all -a "/sbin/reboot" {to reboot all servers(as per the inventory)}
ansible <host> -m <module>
ansible target1 -m ping {target 1 as per the inventory}
```

# Example playbook
```yaml
# playbook is a list of plays
-
  name: Test ping
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: ping test
      ping:
```

If we try to run this 
```yaml
name: Test ping
hosts: all
tasks:
  - name: ping test
    ping:

```
we get this error:

Another example

example of another multilplay:


```yaml
-
    name: 'Execute two commands on localhost'
    hosts: localhost
    tasks:
        -
            name: 'Execute a date command'
            command: date
        -   
            name: 'Execute a command to display hosts file'
            command: 'cat /etc/hosts'

```


Multi host:
```yaml
-
    name: 'Execute two commands on web_node1'
    hosts: server1, Server2
    tasks:
```

```yaml
-
    name: 'Execute command to display date on web_node1'
    hosts: server_1
    tasks:
        -
            name: 'Execute a date command'
            command: date
- 
    name: 'Execute a command to display hosts file contents on web_node2'
    hosts: server_2
    tasks:
        -
            name: 'Execute a command to display hosts file'
            command: 'cat /etc/hosts'
```

-
    name: 'Stop the web services on web server nodes'
    hosts: web_nodes

            name: 'Stop the web services on web server nodes'
            command: 'service httpd stop'

            command: 'service mysql stop'

-
    name: 'Restart all servers (web and db) at once'
    hosts: all_nodes
    tasks:

            name: 'Start the database services on db server nodes'
            command: 'service mysql start'

    name: 'Start the web services on web server nodes'
    hosts: web_nodes 
    tasks:
