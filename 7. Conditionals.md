# When
Can be used to perform checks like so:
```yaml
---
	- name: Conditional_playbook
	- hosts: all
	- tasks:
		- name: download docker
		  apt:
		  	name: docker
				state: present
		  when: ansible_os_family == "debian"
	
	- name: Conditional_playbook
	- hosts: all
	- tasks:
		- name: download docker
		  yum:
		  	name: docker
				state: present
		  when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

# OR or AND

```yaml
---
	- name: Conditional_playbook
	  hosts: all
	  tasks:
		- name: download docker
		  apt:
		  	name: docker
				state: present
		  when: ansible_os_family == "debian" and
		  	ansible_distribution_version == "16.x"
	
	- name: Conditional_playbook
	  hosts: all
	  tasks:
		- name: download docker
		  yum:
		  	name: docker
				state: present
		  when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat" or
		  	ansible_os_famile == "SUSE"
```


# Conditional Loops

## Important

```yaml
---
	- name: Installing using loops
		hosts: all
		vars:
			packages: #variable name
			### list of packages to be installed
				- name: docker
				  required: True
				- name: nmap
				  required: True
				- name: nikto
				  required: False
				  
		 tasks:
		 	- name: Install "{{ Item.name }}"
			 	  apt:
				    name: "{{ item.name }}"
					state: present
					when: item.required == True
					loop: "{{ packages }}"				  
				
```

To visualise better {loop opened}:
```yaml
# expanding that loop we get like this:
- name: Install Docker
	vars:
		item:
			name: doccker
			required: True
	apt:
		name: {{ item.name }}
		state: present
	when: item.required == True
```

```yaml
- name: Install nmap
	vars:
		item:
			name: nmap
			required: True
	apt:
		name: {{ item.name }}
		state: present
	when: item.required == True
```

```yaml
- name: Install Docker
	vars:
		item:
			name: nikto
			required: True
	apt:
		name: {{ item.name }}
		state: present
	when: item.required == True
```

# ==Important==

A program to send an email to the administrator is a given package is not present on the system.

```yaml
---
	- name: mail if a service is down
	  hosts: all
	  tasks:
	  # command to check the status of the bugs
	  	- command: service httpd status
		  register: result ## this will save the output of a command
		  # now we check if the service is up or not
		  - mail:
			to: admin@corp.com
			subject: service down
			body: service down
			
			when: result.stdout.find('down') != -1 
```
